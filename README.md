# Remote

Hey! Thanks for checking this out ðŸ˜ƒ

To run the project smoothly, please make sure you have Elixir 1.10.4 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 23)

To run the project and start your Phoenix server:
  * Clone this project with `git clone **project link**` - choose the link, when you click on the clone button above.
  * cd into project with `cd remote`
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup` - go get some coffee or a drink, it will take a minute or two.
  (we have a million records, so seriously, get a drink and let the magic work itself.)
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now, you can use the browser, or postman, or curl and hit the endpoint `http://localhost:4000/` and see that magic you started ðŸ˜‰
